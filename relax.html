<h1> Glad that you are Relaxed!! </h1>
<p> Don't forget too much relaxation and procastination is bad too</p>
<p> Tips to overcome Procastination</p>
<li> Large tasks can feel overwhelming and lead to procrastination. Break them down into smaller, manageable pieces to make them less intimidating.
</li>
<li>It’s good to relax, but set a timer for 10-15 minutes. Once it goes off, get back to work. </li>
<li>If a task can be completed in 2 minutes or less, do it immediately. This helps you avoid the temptation of putting it off and losing momentum.
</li>
<li> Allocate specific blocks of time for different tasks and activities. This prevents excessive relaxing and helps you stay focused.</li>
<li> Study Groups can help keep you on track and create a sense of responsibility to get work done. </li>
<li> Set a clear intention for your breaks (e.g., “I’ll stretch and drink water”) rather than defaulting to mindless activities.</li>
