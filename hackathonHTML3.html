    <h1>Study Techniques</h1>
    <p>Here is a list of some of our favourite study techiniques.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="buffer1">
        <h1>Pomodoro Technique: </h1>
        <p>The Pomodoro technique spaces out work into short periods of time (ex. 25 mins).The technique works as follows:</p>
        <p> 1. Choose what you want to focus on and set your a timer to your desired time period.</p>
        <p> 2. Focus until the timer goes off.</p>
        <p> 3. Take a short break.</p>
        <p> 4. After 4 of these "focus periods" (AKA Pomodoros), take a longer break.</p>

        <h1>Feynman Technique:</h1>
        <p> This study technique is based on the idea that if you want to understand a concept, you try to teach it.</p>
        <p>1. Choose a topic and write down everyting that you know about the topic.</p>
        <p>2. Try to explain the concept in a simple manner, as if you were teaching someone who has no knowledge on the subject.</p>
        <p>3. Go back to what you wrote and see if you were correct, check if there were places where you need to improve.</p>
        <p>4. If there was anything that could be broken down into more simple language, go back and rewrite these parts.</p>

    <h1>Retrieval Practice:</h1> 
    <p>This method focuses on the act of retrieving the information that you.</p>
    <p>studied at a previous time. This method helps with</p>
    <p>recalling information that can be used at a later date (ie. a test, exam, etc.)</p>
    <p>1. Put away your notes.</p>
    <p>2. Grab a sheet of paper and write down everything that you remember about the topic.</p>
    <p>3. Check your notes to see if there was anything that you got wrong. Use this technique as a way to find out what you should focus on.</p>

        <p>Here are ways to manage academic stress.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="buffer1">
    <h1> Plan Ahead: </h1>
    <p>Knowing when a test is or when an assignment is due can save you a lot of trouble! Putting all of the dates of tests and when assignments are due</p>
    <p>can give you a good overview of what needs to be done first. You can aso try to set some goals that you want to accomplish during a certain time period</p>
    <p>such as trying all of the practice problems in a chapter before the weekend. If you set goals ask yourself these questions first.</p>
    <p>S - Specific, What do I need to accompish?</p>
    <p>M - Measurable, How do I know when I have accomplished my goal?</p>
    <p>A - Achievable, Can I realistically reach my goal?</p>
    <p>R - Relevant, Does acheiving this goal help me in any way?</p>
    <p>T - Time-bound, How much time do I have to accomplish my goal?</p>

    <h1>Don't Fall Behind:</h1>
    <p>Falling behind in a class makes it difficult to understand what is happening in future lectures.</p> 
    <p>Classes were designed with the idea that you already understand the ideas that were taught in the previously.</p>
    <p>You can get help by reaching out to your instructor to go over a concept that you find difficult, but it's important to 
    understand these topics ASAP so that you can understand future topics that may buid on these.</p>

    <h1>Speak to Someone:</h1>
    <p>Some post-secondary insitutions have counselling services for their students, which would be a good place for you to talk about what you're going
    through and to get help. </p>

    <div class="buffer1">
    <h1>Sleep:</h1>
    <p>Getting enough sleep is important becasue your body and mind need to rest. Not having </p>
    <p>enough sleep can lead to problems with learning, focusing, and remembering things. These are </p>
    <p>all the things that can greatly affect you as a post-secondary student.</p>

    <h1>Staying Active:</h1>
    <p>Physical acitivty can improve your self esteem, making you feel better about yourself. Being active</p>
    <p>also causes chemical changes to your brain that improves your mood.</p>

    <h1>Being Social:</h1>
    <p>Socailising is incredibly important to maintaining good mental wellbeing, especially in a post-Covid era. Being social allows you to</p>
    <p>make connections which gives you a sense of belonging. Being around others also allows you to recieve emotional</p>
    <p>support as well as allows you to give it to others.</p>
