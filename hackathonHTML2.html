    <div class="section2">
        <p>
            This is something that you are going to deal with alot throughout your time at post-secondary, so it's best that you
            know how to effectively manage it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Plan Ahead:
            Knowing when a test is or when an assignment is due can save you a lot of trouble! Putting all of the dates of tests and when assignments are due
            can give you a good overview of what needs to be done first. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Don't fall Behind:
            Falling behind in a class is something that you do want to happen during post-secondary. Falling behind makes it difficult to understand what is happening
            during the current lecture as well as the future lectures. Becuase they were designed with the idea that you already understand the ideas that were 
            taught in the previous lectures. You can get help by reaching out to your instructor to go over a concept that you find difficult, but it is important to 
            understand these topics so that you can understand ones in the future. 
        </p>

    <h1>Speak to someone</h1>
<div>
        <p>
            Some post-secondary institutions provide consuling for their students, this is a great place for you to talk about how you fell and to get help while on campus.
            If what you are dealing with is an academic matter, ask your instructors for help and clarification or go to peer tutoring sessions.
